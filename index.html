	  <p><img src="img/iStock_000016476002Small.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>The topic I decided to talk about is helping people, I think that now a days thatthe world has suffered many tragedies, we need more than ever to stay with each other, and help each other trying to do actions that can change the world in a positive way, many associations all around the world are comming together to help people, animals, natural resources, among other things, I thought the other day while I was watching the news in my house that a lot of people actually don't care about children, woman, and men that are in war, that have nothing to do with it but somehow they are the most affected, the ones that suffer the most, they suffer from hunger, dehidration, and deseases, not just here in South America, or the poberty in Mexico, I also thought about all those people in Siria, Afganistan, that have years in war, and it doesn't seams that it'a going to stop any further.</p>
	  <p>Sometimes we think for example in the wars against many terrorists in Afganistan, but we don´t think in the people that didn't do anything to deserve a war, and that are in the middle of this, and can´t get away, so my program: HELP FOR HUMANITY, is about all of this, ypo can help in many ways to help all those people, some examples are: giving money, so we can buy food, clothes, and medicines, or giving things that you don't longer need but are in good state like: toys, clothes, and even electronic devaices, we thank you for coming to our page.</p>

<section id="why">
	<div>I think the main reason that I chose this topic is because when I watch the news about the situation in different cuntries like: Siria, Afaganistan, and Africa, watching this horrible things they have been through and are still hapening, it just breaks my heart, and I think that we are lucky that we are not in the same situation that they are, we complain about a lot of things, but when we compare our lifes with the life of people in a cuntry in war, we are the luckiest, so I wanted to show people what this people is suffering, so they can see how lucky and blessed they are.

 <p><img src="file:///C|/Users/alumnoUTM/Downloads/descarga.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/>Helping can be something that can change situations, lifes, and one of the most beautiful things that can ever exist, we have the power of changing situations in peoples lifes to a brighter side, imagine if everyone would help to change situations, not just to this people, to everyone that needs it or feels that can´t take it any more, the world would be so much more better.</p>
